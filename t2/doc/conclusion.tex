\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing an RC circuit as 
been achieved. The  analysis  of  the circuit was done both theoretically,
 using the Octave maths tool to solve the equations obtained by using methods
  such as node analysis, and useful theorems, such as the Norton equivalent circuit.
   Octave was also used to plot the time evolution of certain voltages. for points 1)
    to 3) the simulation results perfectly matched the theoretical results. We however 
    noticed that, according to the simulation, v(n6) was in phase with $V_s$; whilst, according
     to the theoretical results, these two were slightly off phase. The difference between the
      simulation and the theoretical results isn't significant, as a side by side comparison 
      of the plots will show. The discrepancies might be due to the fact that the simulation 
      solves a differential equation numerically, whereas we solved an algebraic system of 
      equations to determine the same values.
