% state the learning objective 
In this laboratory assignment we seek to build an audio amplifier circuit
, with the goal of maximizing the merit figure, $M$, given by:
\begin{equation*}
        M = \frac{voltageGain * bandwidth}{cost * lowerCutoffFreq}
\end{equation*}
being that the voltage gain is given by the quotient between the output voltage and 
the input voltage; the bandwidth is the magnitude of the interval of frequencies
 for which the circuit functions; and the lower cut off frequency is given 
 by the lowest frequency for which the circuit functions. The cost 
 equals the sum of the cost of each individual component.
\par The circuit consists only of resistors, 
voltage sources (AC as well as DC), capacitors 
and bipolar junction transistors (more specifically one 
PNP transistor and one NPN transistor)

The circuit used was the following:

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
