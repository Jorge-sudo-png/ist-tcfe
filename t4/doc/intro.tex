% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing
various resistors, two voltage sources and two current sources. The circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:circuit}.


In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
