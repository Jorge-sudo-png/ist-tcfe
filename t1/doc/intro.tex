% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing a
two voltage sources, two current sources and seven resistors. The circuit
will be analysed using first the mesh method and later the nodal method.
The circuit can be seen if Figure~\ref{fig:circuit}.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. First a mesh method aproach is used in subsection~\ref{subsec:mesh}, then we use the nodal method aproach in subsection~\ref{subsec:nodal}. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}, where we compare theoretical and simulation results.
