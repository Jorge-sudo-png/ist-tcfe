\section{Theoretical Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

In this section, the circuit shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ciruit} is analysed
theoretically, first we aproach the circuit using the mesh analysis, and later we analyse the circuit using the nodal analysis.

\subsection{Mesh Analysis}

As seen during theoretical lessons, we can use a mesh analysis to analyse the circuit.
This method is built upon Kirchhoff's Voltage Law that states:

In a mesh, the sum of all voltages equals 0.

\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=0}^{n} V_i = 0
  \label{eq:kvl}
\end{equation}

Because $v_O$ is the voltage between capacitor C's plates, it is related to the
current $i$ by
\begin{equation}
  i(t) = C\frac{dv_O}{dt}.
\end{equation}

Hence, Equation~(\ref{eq:kvl}) can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
  RC\frac{dv_O}{dt} + v_O(t) = v_I.
  \label{eq:kvl2}
\end{equation}

Equation~(\ref{eq:kvl2}) is a linear differencial equation whose solution is a
superposition of a natural solution $v_{On}$ and a forced solution $v_{Of}$:

\begin{equation}
  v_O(t) = v_{On}(t) + v_{Of}(t).
  \label{eq:vo_sol}
\end{equation}

As learned in the theory classes the natural solution is of the form
\begin{equation}
  v_{On}(t) = Ae^{-\frac{t}{RC}},
  \label{eq:vo_nat}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is an integration constant.

The forced solution is of the form given in Equation~(\ref{eq:vo_for}) and is
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:forced}.

\begin{equation}
  V_{Of}(t) = |\bar{V}_{Of}| cos(\omega t + \angle \bar{V}_{Of}),
  \label{eq:vo_for}
\end{equation}
