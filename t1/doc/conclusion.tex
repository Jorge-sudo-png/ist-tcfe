\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing a simple circuit has been
achieved. The analysis of the circuit was done both theoretically, using  the Ocatve maths tool
 to solve the systems of equations obtained by using the mesh and node analysis, and by circuit
  simulation, using Ngspice. The simulation results perfectly matched the theoretical results.
   The reason for this perfect match is that the analysed circuit is linear, so that any method 
   for analysing consists in solving a linear system of equations.
